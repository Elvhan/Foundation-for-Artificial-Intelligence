### Overview
This project simulates a cash withdrawal system for a bank in Indonesia, where customers can request to withdraw all their savings in cash. The program assists the bank in calculating the number and types of cash denominations required to fulfill a customer's withdrawal request.

### Problem Statement
In Indonesia, cash is available in the following denominations:
- **Paper Money:** Rp 100,000, Rp 50,000, Rp 20,000, Rp 10,000, Rp 5,000, Rp 2,000
- **Coins:** Rp 1,000, Rp 500, Rp 200, Rp 100

The objective is to fulfill the requested amount using the fewest pieces of cash, prioritizing the largest denominations.

### Features
- Calculates the quantity of each denomination needed.
- Separates totals for paper money and coins.
- Displays any amount that cannot be disbursed using the available denominations.
